# UK Tenancy Rights Guide

## Your Rights as a Tenant

Your rights as a tenant in the UK depend on the type of tenancy you have. Most private tenants have an assured shorthold tenancy.

## Deposit Protection

Your landlord must protect your deposit in a government-approved scheme within 30 days of receiving it. The three approved schemes are:
- Deposit Protection Service (DPS)
- MyDeposits
- Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS)

If your landlord fails to protect your deposit, you may be entitled to compensation of 1-3 times the deposit amount.

## Rent Increases

Your landlord cannot increase rent during a fixed-term tenancy unless:
- There's a rent review clause in your tenancy agreement
- You agree to the increase

For periodic tenancies, your landlord must give you at least one month's notice for increases and cannot increase rent more than once per year.

## Property Condition

You have the right to live in a property that is safe and in good repair. Your landlord is responsible for:
- Structural repairs
- Heating and hot water systems
- Gas and electrical safety
- Fire safety measures

## Section 21 Notices

A Section 21 notice is a 'no-fault' eviction notice. Your landlord must: - Give you at least 2 months' notice
- Use the correct form (Form 6A)
- Have protected your deposit properly
- Provided gas safety certificates and Energy Performance Certificate
- Not serve notice in the first 4 months of tenancy
